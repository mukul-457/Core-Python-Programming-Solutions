!!!! Hello Folks !!!!

This is for all those like me who are willing to learn python language

I just stumbled across this awesome book "Core Python programming"
which is available at : https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCvdq9n5HcAhVKp48KHS0fBh0QFggpMAA&url=ftp%3A%2F%2Fwww.mans.edu.eg%2FLearn%2FPython%2Fpdf%2FCore%2520Python%2520Programming%25202000.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1p9hBjuyy3KpjGiizid-Oz

I read few chapters and then i decided to start uploding solution of some interesting exercises on GitHub

Folder structure is as follow:

    All folder are named after chapter ( obvious from their name :P)
